We Scrape the Time-Series Price Data from Futbin.com for every Fifa 19 Player 
 
The purpose of this project is to acquire time-series price data for every Fifa 19 Player.
The individual Player data is readily available but the respective virtual price can only be viewed in the game or on certain websites. We retrieve not just the current price but also the price history for each player. To do so we first scrape the specific Futbin-ID for each player and subsequently get the price time-series data. Along the way we save and upload the files as CSVs.  
Please use this code responsibly! Do not just randomly put a load on their servers!
And if you do, you may want to split your requests into smaller entities.
